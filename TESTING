Loading a translator written in Python using the glupy meta translator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'test.vol' is a simple volfile with the debug-trace Python translator on top
of a brick. The volfile can be mounted using the the following command.

$ glusterfs --debug -f test.vol /path/to/mntpt

If then file operations are performed on the newly mounted file system, log
output would be printed by the Python translator on the standard output.
